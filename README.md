A tool which repeats a command n amounts of time, with paralellisation and slight tweaks.

### Installation
```bash
go install github.com/baalimago/repeater@latest
```

## Usage
Since v1.2, repeater will re-attempt the command until successful.
A success is a command returning exit code 0.
Set flag `-retryOnFail=false` if you simply wish to repeat the CMD `-n` amount of times, regardless of outcome.

Usecases: 
* CRUD state using curl as fast as you have network sockets
* Paralellize repetitive shell-scripts
* Ghetto benchmarking

```bash
repeater \
    -n 100 `# repeat 100 times` \
    -w 10 ` # using 10 workers` \
    -file ./run_output `        # with file ./run_output` \
    -output FILE `              # with command output written to some file` \
    -progress BOTH `            # with progress written to BOTH stdout and some file` \
    curl example.com `          # command to repeat`
```

```bash
# This will print "this is increment: 1\nthis is increment: 2\n..."
repeater -n 100 -output STDOUT -progress HIDDEN -increment echo "this is increment: INC"

# Show all available flags
repeater -h
```

## Benchmarks

Run `./benchmark.sh` to try out repeaters performance vs similar parallelization tools.
You may benchmark any command that you want, simply run `benchmark <YOUR COMMAND>`.
